		<article>
		<p>My name is Mohamed Kamara, I am originally from Liberia, a small country off the coast of West Africa. My interest in computer
		started as far back as 1995 while in high school and since then I have made it a career. Before Fullsail, I worked on technical
		support, but ever since I knew that development was something I really like doing, especially, the Web backend.
